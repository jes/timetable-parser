NAME
    Timetable.pm - convert a University of Bath HTML timetable to an
    iCalendar file

SYNOPSIS
        use Timetable qw/ical_for_url ical_as_string/;

        my @start = (2011, 10, 3);
        my $ical = ical_for_url( \@start, $url_to_timetable_page );

        print ical_as_string( $ical );

DESCRIPTION
    The University of Bath give timetables in HTML files which are
    needlessly difficult to use. For example:

    http://timetables.bath.ac.uk:4090/reporting/individual?identifier=Secon
    d+year+Chemistry+with+Management&weeks=19-32&idtype=name&objectclass=pr
    ogramme%2Bof%2Bstudy%2Bgroups

    This module is capable of scraping these pages and outputting iCalendar
    (RFC 2445) files containing the events.

DATA STRUCTURE
    The iCalendar structures returned by many of these functions are
    arrayrefs containing hashrefs describing events.

    For example:

        [
            {
                'SUMMARY' => 'CM20218-Leca 6W 1.1',
                'DURATION' => 'PT50M',
                'RRULE' => 'FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=15',
                'EXDATE' => '20120402T091500,20120409T091500',
                'DTSTART' => '20120206T091500'
            }
        ];

    for a one-event structure with those properties. See RFC 2445 for what
    they mean.

FUNCTIONS
  ical_for_url $start, $url[, $outlook_mode]
    $start should be an array reference of the form [ $year, $month, $day ]
    describing the date of the first monday in the timetabling period. How
    this is determined is an exercise for the module user (realistically,
    you have to just get it manually from the university semester dates).

    Set $outlook_mode to something true to get separate events for each
    week.

    Return an iCalendar structure describing the page at the given $url or
    undef if there is an error.

  ical_for_html $start, $html[, $outlook_mode]
    $start is as for ical_for_url.

    Set $outlook_mode to something true to get separate events for each
    week.

    Return an iCalendar structure describing the page in $html or undef if
    there is an error.

  ical_for_dom $start, $dom[, $outlook_mode]
    $start is as for ical_for_url.

    Set $outlook_mode to something true to get separate events for each
    week.

    Return an iCalendar structure describinbg the page in the HTML::DOM in
    $dom or undef if there is an error.

  ical_as_string $ical
    Return a string representation of the given iCalendar structure,
    suitable for writing to a .ics file.
